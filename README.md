# Static Template (without css preprocessor)

I use this template when I do web site cording from nothing using Browsersync.  
(including jQuery plugin Owl Carousel 2 and Superfish)

## Usage

First of all you have to do this.  

```
1. npm install  
2. npm run pre  
3. npm start  
```

To make sprite image:  
``gulp sprite``  
then, to concatenate with style.css:  
``gulp postSprite``  

To make webfont(iconfont):  
``gulp iconfont``  
then, to concatenate with style.css:  
``gulp postIconfont``
